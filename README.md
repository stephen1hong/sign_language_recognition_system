# sign_language_recognition_system
The overall goal of this project is to build a word recognizer for American Sign Language video sequences, demonstrating the power of
probabalistic models. In particular, this project employs hidden Markov models (HMM's) to analyze a series of measurements taken from 
videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research (see the RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database)

The raw data, train, and test sets are pre-defined. You will derive a variety of feature sets (explored in Part 1), as well as implement 
three different model selection criterion to determine the optimal number of hidden states for each word model (explored in Part 2).
Finally, in Part 3 you will implement the recognizer and compare the effects the different combinations of feature sets and model selection 
criteria.
